# Computational Functional Square Root

Draft ideas.

## Lambda Calculus with Finite Types (𝟘, 𝟙, +, ×)

This is harder than reversible languages. Consider embedding in reversible functions.

## Reversible Programming Languages (𝟘, 𝟙, +, ×)

Reversible programming languages with finite types can be compiled to permutations, so we start with square root(s) of permutations:
- for odd cycles after decomposition : re-arrange the cycle
- for even cycles after decomposition : 
  - classical algorithm(s) - 
  - non-classical algorithm(s) -
  - f²g = h

## Applications

- Half-sorting 
- Quantum computing
- Sync without buffer
- Timing attack
- ...

## Others

- Analytic functional square roots 
- Derivatives and Differentiable programming
- Fast Fourier Transform
