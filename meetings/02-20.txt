- Functional Square Roots (the analytic way)
 - Runge Phenomenon
 - Iterative Roots

- Interpreter for Theseus-like language
 - based on type isomorphisms

- Computing with Square root of Not

- A class of Recursive Permutations which is 
  Primitive Recursive complete

- Permutation: typeless
  Any familiar stuff: types
  
- Instead of encoding in a language
  something more mathematical which
  is easier to reason interms of sqr.
  root.

- Sqr. root <-> COP

- Go back to motivations
  With a few sqr. roots ... 

- Permutation Algebra for constructing 
  reversible circuits
 - square root of bit permutations?
 - identification of cycles ...
